# Ipsums

> Generate random amounts of lorem ipsum text

A tiny library (function) to help out when creating mockups or prototype on the web.

```js
import lorem from 'https://unpkg.com/ipsums';

lorem(2); // => "Lorem ipsum."
lorem(5); // => "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."
```

There are currently no other options. Perhaps being able to the following would be desireable:

- Generating multiple sentences
- Punctuation preferences
- Configurable jitter (something like ~X words)
- Construct random image urls from unsplash
- Support links to random svg icons

Pull requests for the above are welcomed. Request or suggest features by submitting an issue!
